# Phish-Shield
Chrome Extension to detect phishing websites

In today’s digital landscape, phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated, targeting users through deceptive websites designed to steal sensitive information. PhishShield is a real-time phishing detection Chrome extension built to safeguard users against such online threats. Leveraging machine learning and rule-based analysis, the extension examines critical features of websites—including URL structure, domain age, SSL certificate presence, and content patterns—to accurately classify web pages as legitimate or malicious. PhishShield integrates multiple detection techniques including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes algorithms, enhancing detection accuracy and reducing false positives. It also utilizes external APIs such as Google Safe Browsing for dynamic threat updates, and an adaptive phishing database that learns from new patterns. Designed with minimal performance impact, the extension operates seamlessly in the background, instantly alerting users when a potential phishing attempt is detected.This project aims to provide an accessible, lightweight, and effective browser-based security solution for everyday internet users, enhancing web safety through proactive and intelligent threat detection.
